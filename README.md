# MorseCode
This code was extremely stressfull, but I think I did it. I am not sure if were allowed to use a hashmap, but the tutor reccommended it and it made the program alot easier for me. To change the morsecode you want to input, you must change it within the code. I was initially thinking about making it user input but getting it to work as it is was already challeneging enough.
